\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
  This report covers the complete design process for EEE3061W Mechatronics Design Project for 2015.  The project involves the design, manufacture and testing of a legged, autonomous, bi-athletic robot that will be able to partake in a 5m sprint and then throw a weighted ping-pong ball.  The robot is to adhere to a set of specifications as provided by the course management. \\

  The entire project is split into two sections, each covering the semester's task.  The first section involved the sprinting aspect of the robot, and the second involved line following and launching.  The relevant sections are named accordingly.

  \subsection{Sprinter Introduction}
  \label{sub:Sprinter Introduction}
    In summary, the sprinting robot was to make use of a digital 3-axis gyroscope in an attempt to sprint 5m as fast as possible within a f ixed-width lane (maintain fixed heading).  The robot was also specified to start the sprint when green light from a set of three lights was detected, signaling the beginning of the race. \\

    The locomotion design was constrained to the use of legs, making use of a mechanical linkage-type system to convert rotational motion from the provided motors into linear motion to move forward.  Other restrictions included the dimensions of the entire robot and out-of-pocket components budget.

  \subsection{Launcher Introduction}
  \label{sub:Launcher Introduction}
    The second stage of the project required the robot to first navigate along a line (autonomously) into a box and then throw a weighted ping-pong ball as far as possible. The launching mechanism was limited to the use of a lever system, driven by a DC motor provided.  The rest of the restrictions follow from the Sprinter as well. \\

  The development of both robots followed the same design process whereby 3 conceptual designs were proposed and one final design (or a combination of ideas from more than one) was developed upon further after having drawn up a pros and cons comparison.  The final design was, at this stage, separated into the electronic and mechanical aspects.  As such, they are discussed separately.  Mechanical designs were modelled using 3D CAD (either SolidWorks or AutoDesk Inventor) and electronics were drawn up in Altium Designer.

\section{Sprinter Design Concepts}
\label{sec:Sprinter Design Concepts}
  \subsection{Design Concept 1}
  \label{sub:Design Concept 1}
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \label{fig:3dConcept1}
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{DesignConcept1RenderCropped}
        \caption{3D Render of Sprinter Design Concept 1}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    The first sprinter design concept is one which incorporates the Klann Linkage system in the leg design. This allows direct conversion of rotary motion from the motors to linear motion in the legs. The body design, which is somewhat complex, is octagonal in shape, with the angled panels fastened using internal brackets bolted onto the inside. This design is aesthetically appealing however, may make it difficult to access the internal components once the design is completed.  Also, the body restricts the height of the gearing system within. The leg system is a standard Klann Linkage with 8 legs. The legs are connected in pairs, situated on each side of the body, which are run by the same gear (i.e. each motor controls one side each of the leg system).  The main advantage of the extra 4 legs is to provide improved stability. Definitive of the Klann Linkage system, each stride lasts for 180 degrees of each revolution, and so having two legs per revolution, the leg group is able to provide at least one leg for the full revolution. This means there will be 4 legs on the ground at all times during the robot's motion. Although not shown in the rendering, the gearing system would have the final output on the outside of the main body, with the gears placed between the rotating disks. This prevents physical interference at any point during the leg cycles.\\

    The rendering is not necessarily to scale or proportion.  Due to restrictions in volume and dimensions, the legs would be shorter and body closer to the ground.

  \subsection{Design Concept 2}
  \label{sub:Design Concept 2}
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{DesignConcept2RenderCropped}
        \caption{3D Render of Design Concept 2}
        \label{fig:3dConcept2}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    The second design concept is somewhat similar to the previous one, but with one important difference: the left and right leg pairings are driven by a single, central driving gear. The main body of the robot is also similar to the previous design, but with an open rear to make it easier to access internal components. The front of the main body acts primarily as a visor to help protect the components to some extent during the motion. This is also an attempt to minimize weight, but compromises the aesthetic appeal as all the components will be visible. The same 8-leg Klann Linkage system is employed here as well. The gearing system and motor placement will be the same as the previous concept, as the ratios and general internal configuration will be the same.

  \subsection{Design Concept 3}
  \label{sub:Design Concept 3}
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{DesignConcept3RenderCropped}
        \caption{3D Render of Design Concept 3}
        \label{fig:3dConcept3}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    The third and final design again employs the Klann Linkage system. The primary difference is that the legs are now placed closer towards the front and back of the main body rather than on the sides. The general body shape is box-like as this will be most efficient to accommodate this particular leg system. The motor and gear placement would also be different: they would be placed on the front and back, with the circuitry and control system placed more centrally. The 8-piece Klann Linkage legs would be most stable in this orientation and allow greater body width. This implementation, however, will result in an overall loss in body length.

  \label{tab:comparison1}
  \caption{Table of pros and cons for each of the three design concepts}
  \end{table}

  Given the pros and cons of each, a combination of the leg design from concept 1 and the body design from concept 2 was decided upon. This provides a good speed design, a simple but functional body design, as well as good weight distribution with the gears placed at the back, while the battery pack placed is at the front.\\

  Figure~\ref{fig:moduleplanview1}  below shows a conceptual feature plan of the above chosen design:

    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Other Design Considerations}
  \label{sub:Other Design Considerations}
    The Jansen linkage was another concept that we considered for the legs. Its primary advantage over the Klann linkage is that it is notably faster. It is also more stable when dealing with obstacles. Despite this, however, the linkage system as well as its complex implementation would be considerably more difficult. The increased number of linkages per leg would make assembly as well as dimensioning and optimizing very difficult. This is the primary reason why we decided not to consider it for our final design.

  \subsection{Potential Improvements}
  \label{sub:Potential Improvements}
    One possible design improvement would be to implement the use of oval gears instead of circular for the final output gear. By doing this with the correct orientation, the legs would have a longer contact time with the ground as the downward motion would be slower. This would serve to increase the torque of each leg. As well as this, the upward leg motion would be faster, resulting in a shorter stride time and an overall increase in speed because a smaller gear ratio would then be used.\\

    As mentioned above, the legs should be shortened and widened, offering more height to the body, lower center of gravity for stability and extra strength in the legs.

% SPRINTER PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\clearpage
\section{Sprinter Preliminary Calculations}
\label{sec:Sprinter Preliminary Calculations}
  \subsection{Gear Ratio}
  \label{sub:Gear Ratio}
    The gear ratio is entirely dependent of the minimum torque that would be required per leg in order to move the robot forward. As per the specifications, the output rpm of the motors is too high to directly drive the legs whilst providing enough torque to overcome the inertia of the body. An initial calculation for the minimum torque would be enough to determine the best gear ratio.\\

    \begin{equation}
      \text{Torque} = \text{force}\times\text{distance}
    \end{equation}

    The weight of the overall design, as well as its perpendicular distance from the legs in contact with the ground would easily determine the minimum torque needed in order to drive the robot. \\

    Mass of Robot = 510g \\
    Distance from Leg = 7.5 cm

    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{split}
        \therefore \text{Torque} &= \frac{510\left(7.5\right)}{2}\\
                                 &\approx 1913 \text{g}\cdot\text{cm}
      \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Given that the ratio of the input and output torque would be the same as the gear ratio, the final gear ratio would therefore be:

    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{split}
        \text{Ratio} &= \frac{1913}{220} \\
                     &\approx 9
      \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    The gear arrangement can be seen in Fig. 3.1.

\label{sec:Sprinter Electronic Design}
  % Intro
  The robot was to use its two 6V DC motors for controlled, autonomous, forwards motion in a straight line. Given the project constraints, this was to be achieved using an STM32F051C6 microcontroller and a 3-axis MEMS\footnote{MicroElectroMechanical System} gyroscope, an L3GD20. The robot was to start this motion when a green light is detected positioned behind the robot. A complete electronic system was developed to provide this functionality and implemented as described below.

  \subsection{System Components}
  \label{sub:System Components}
    \subsubsection{The STM32F051C6 Microcontroller}
    \label{subs:The STM32F051C6 Microcontroller}
      The STM32F051C6 microcontroller is a 32-bit, 48 Mhz entry level microcontroller\textsuperscript{\cite{stm32f051c6Datasheet}} with a host of peripherals for communication and other digital and analog interaction.

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=0.3\columnwidth]{STM32}
          \caption{The STM32F051C6 product graphic}
          \label{fig:STM32}
        \end{center}
      \end{figure}

      This microcontroller was used to process sensory data including temperature, buttons for user input, light sensor readings and data from the gyroscope and calculate motor speeds to drive the robot forwards on the race track between the outer boundaries. More detail about the software implemented on the microcontroller is provided in Section \ref{sec:Sprinter Control and Software}.

    \subsubsection{The L3GD20 Gyroscope}
    \label{subs:The L3GD20 Gyroscope}
      The L3GD20, also manufactured by ST Microelectronics, was implemented using a carrier board\footnote{L3GD20 carrier board - \url{https://www.pololu.com/product/2125}} shown in Figure~\ref{fig:l3gd20Pic1}. The device communicated using SPI and was programmable for different modes of operation, filters, power modes and more.

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=0.35\columnwidth]{l3gd20Pic1}
          \caption{The L3GD20 3-axis gyroscope and carrier board}
          \label{fig:l3gd20Pic1}
        \end{center}
      \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{L293DNE}
    \label{subs:L293DNE}
      The L293DNE is a quadruple half-H motor driver IC\footnote{L293DNE Motor Driver - \url{http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf}} which was used to drive the two 6V DC motors. Using this IC, it was possible to vary the speed of the motor using a PWM signal and it also provided isolation between the high and low current areas in the system. The drivers had a continuous current output of 600mA and a maximum peak current output of 1.2A across a voltage range of 4.5V to 36V. The PDIP (NE) package used included protection diodes for inductive transient suppression as a result of the inductive loads of the DC motors.

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=0.35\columnwidth]{L293DNEPic1}
          \caption{The L293DNE Quad half-H Motor Driver IC}
          \label{fig:L293DNEPic1}
        \end{center}
      \end{figure}


    \subsection{System Overview}
    \label{sub:System Overview}
      The above components, along with other peripheral components, made up the electronic system for the robot. It was decided that the system be divided into two sections, the ``ControllerBoard'' and the ``PowerBoard'', so that the high current circuitry could be safely isolated from the sensitive low current components such as the microcontroller and gyroscope. This is often necessary especially when serial communication lines are present in the system.\\

      Figure~\ref{fig:sprinterElectronicSystemBlockDiagram} below shows a high level block diagram of the electronic system including both the Controller and Power sections.  This was later to be designed and drawn out in Altium Designer for PCB manufacture.

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{sprinterElectronicSystemBlockDiagram}
          \caption{High level block diagram of the sprinter electronic system}
          \label{fig:sprinterElectronicSystemBlockDiagram}
        \end{center}
      \end{figure}

      The system as well as the motors were to run off a 3-cell LiPo\footnote{Lithium Polymer} battery which had to be regulated for most of the system components. The microcontroller required 3.3V as well as L3GD20 and these sources had to be stable for robust operation. The L293DNE required 5V for logic operation as it isolates this functionality from the power throughput to the motors. The LM35 temperature sensor, as in Figure~\ref{fig:sprinterElectronicSystemBlockDiagram} required a 5V source as well. An WS78L05\footnote{5V Linear Volatge Reagulator - \url{http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm78l05.pdf}} was used for regulation from battery voltage to 5V and after that a MCP17023302\footnote{3V3 Linear Voltage Regulator - \url{http://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/A200/MCP1702_MIC.pdf}} was used to bring the 5V down to 3.3V.\\

      The L293DNE motor driver enabled bidirectional motion for both motors using each of its four half-H-bridges. Each of these had a signal pin, a power output pin and a ground pin. The signal pin was connected to one of the STM32F0's PWM output pin for speed variation. Each pair of half-H-bridges were enabled and disabled using the EN pin, of which the IC has two, using a GPIO digital output pin on the microcontroller. A small ceramic capacitor was placed across each of the motors (not shown in the schamtics further on) to further minimise the effects of the inductive load.\\

      The microcontroller was supplied with the required 3.3V at all of its four supply pins with decoupling at the 3V3 regulator as well as at each 3V3 pin. It was required that the microcontroller operate at its full CPU clock speed of 48MHz and so an 8MHz crystal oscillator was connected to the oscillator pins on the microcontroller which it then scaled up to the maximum speed in an internal phase lock loop.\\

      The L3GD20 makes use of an SPI serial connection involving CLK (clock source), SDA (master out, slave in), SDO (master in, slave out) and GND lines with the microcontroller acting as the master device and the gyroscope as the slave. Through testing, the gyro showed evidence of thermal drift and other inaccuracies and for that reason, an LM35\footnote{Precision Centigrade Thermal Sensor - \url{http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm35.pdf}} was implemented together with one of the microcontroller's ADCs. The LM35 required 5V which was available from the regulator on board.\\

      The light sensor, which was to sense green light only, leveraged the capacitive nature of a green LED which was connected in reverse bias from a microcontroller GPIO pin down to ground. The GPIO pin was configured to output 3.3V for a short period of time and then switched to a digital input to allow build up of charge in the LED to drain through the microcontroller. The time taken for the LED to drain and the voltage to drop below the digital input low threshold was timed internally. The greater the amount of green light which was incident on the LED, the less capacitive the LED in reverse bias was, and hence the quicker it took to discharge. This process is detailed in <>.\\

      Three pushbuttons and two LEDs were added to the system to allow for user input and some program indication as well as another LED for power indication.
